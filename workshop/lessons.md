# Lessons Learned

*(Record patterns of what went wrong and rules to prevent repeating them)*

## Skill design: enumeration vs. judgment

**Pattern:** A skill's behavior was specified by enumerating cases — a hardcoded list of nouns mapped to outcomes, plus a hardcoded list of "examples that DO/DO NOT trigger." Every new case required editing the skill, and the vocabulary tail (synonyms, unusual phrasings, descriptive statements that incidentally contain trigger nouns) was never reachable by enumeration.

**Rule:** When a skill's behavior is best described as *"use judgment"*, don't make it enumerate — express the principle and let the LLM apply it. The skill should describe *the question being asked* (e.g., "is this a fact, a question, or a request?") and *the discriminator* (e.g., "is the substance already present, or being requested generatively?"), not the surface forms that pass/fail. Concrete examples can serve as priming (a small, illustrative set), but they should not be the matching mechanism.

**Test for whether a list belongs in a skill:** ask *"would the skill's behavior be wrong if this list were missing, or just less ergonomic?"* If wrong → the skill has too much enumeration; the case it covers should be derivable from a principle stated elsewhere in the skill. If less ergonomic → the list is fine as priming, keep it short.

**Origin:** issue #25 (dispatcher: judgment-based triggers, replace enumeration). The `xx-datatype` skill's original noun→type mapping table was the case; it broke the atlas's own claim that "new types are pure data — adding one does not require a skill change."

## "Direct-only" handoffs hide transitivity bugs behind a depth assumption

**Pattern:** `bootstrap.sh` cloned only *direct* peers, then `exec make bootstrap` to let the recursive cloner take over. This silently assumed the handoff target (the Makefile, reached through a symlink chain) needed only the direct peer present. True for 2-deep chains, false for 3-deep — and *nothing in the codebase was 3-deep yet*, so the bug was invisible. The recursive cascade that would have fixed it could never start, because starting it required the very substrate it was meant to fetch.

**Rule:** When step A does "just enough" to hand off to step B, write down the invariant A must establish for B to run, then check it holds at the *deepest* input, not the common one. A "clone the direct peer" shortcut is really "ensure B's entrypoint resolves" — make the code do the actual requirement (clone *transitively* until the entrypoint resolves), not the proxy that happens to coincide with it at depth 2.

**Two corollaries that recurred here:**
- A file that runs *before its own substrate exists* (seed-delivered, zero-substrate) cannot share code via symlink — it must inline. Don't fight this; keep the inline copy and lock it to the canonical implementation with a **drift test** (run both on a fixture, assert equal output). One grammar, two call sites, one test.
- `local a="$1" b="$ROOT/$a/..."` on a **single line** can read `$a` as unbound under `set -u` — split positional captures from derived locals onto separate `local` statements.

**Origin:** issue #45 (bootstrap transitive clone walk). Surfaced while designing #44; the brain→nous→ariadne symlink chain was the case that exposed the depth-2 assumption.

## Integration bugs hide where pure tests can't reach — sandbox/IO needs a live run

**Pattern:** issue #44 (openshell sandbox go.mod sync) had thorough hermetic tests for the *pure* logic (`compute_sync_set` rw/ro classification, peer-walk membership) — all green. Yet the first live `make sandbox-build` exposed **three** bugs none of those tests could see: (1) a self-referential `~/workspace → /sandbox/workspace` symlink because `$HOME` is `/sandbox` in the base image (name == target); (2) an `ssh` call I added *inside* a `while read … done < <(…)` loop consumed the loop's stdin and truncated it to the first peer; (3) mutagen won't create a sync-root's missing *parent* dir, so `/sandbox/workspace/<name>` synced 0 files until `/sandbox/workspace` was pre-`mkdir`ed.

**Rule:** for any feature whose substance is IO against an external process (mutagen, ssh, docker, a container's filesystem/`$HOME`), unit tests of the pure decision logic are necessary but **not sufficient** — you must run it against the real thing once before claiming done (AGENTS.md §5). Split the work so the pure core *is* unit-tested (add a `*_LIB_ONLY` source hook to call internal functions without dispatching), then do one live E2E pass; budget for it to find bugs, because it will. Specific tripwires to remember:
- **Don't assume `$HOME`.** Check it (here it was `/sandbox`, not `/home/sandbox`); a symlink whose name equals its resolved target is always a loop. Guard with a string compare, not `-ef` (the inode test falsely falls through when the target doesn't exist yet).
- **`ssh`/`mutagen`/any stdin-reader inside a `while read` loop eats the loop's input.** Read on a dedicated fd (`done 3< <(…)`, `read … <&3`) and pass `ssh -n`.
- **mutagen creates the sync-root leaf but not missing parents** — pre-`mkdir -p` the parent.

**Origin:** issue #44. The bugs were found in three successive live `make sandbox-build` runs against a real `pair` sandbox; the pure suite (6/6) stayed green throughout — it simply couldn't observe them.
