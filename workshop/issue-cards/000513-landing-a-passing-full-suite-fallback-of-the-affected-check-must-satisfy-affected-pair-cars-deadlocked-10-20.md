# landing: a passing full-suite fallback of the affected check must satisfy 'affected' (pair cars deadlocked 10-20)

## Problem

On 10-20 pair's affected check fell back to the full suite on fresh checkouts (the runtime bundle isn't generated,
so the Go graph can't load; pair#738), and the fallback **passed** but posted only `sdlc-local/suite`. `sdlc merge`
then refuses readiness forever: "PR #489 needs recorded local checks on its head: affected". pair#732 (and pair#706)
deadlocked with all checks green; no pair landing for over two hours.
