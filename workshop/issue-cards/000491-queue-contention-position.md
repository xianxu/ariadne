# Suite queue position becomes fictitious on allocation contention

## Problem

Observed while #481's recorded suite waited under real allocation contention: reports alternate between the actual position 3 (ahead contains the train and another waiter) and position 1 with the same next-in-line holder. No suite admission occurred. The new nonblocking secondary-lock callback returns its default empty ahead list when allocation cannot be inspected; acquire interprets len(ahead)+1 as an observed position. This produces false position updates and log churn.
