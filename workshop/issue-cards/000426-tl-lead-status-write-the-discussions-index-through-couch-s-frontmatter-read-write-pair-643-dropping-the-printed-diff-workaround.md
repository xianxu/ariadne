# tl-lead status: write the discussions index through couch's frontmatter read/write (pair#643), dropping the printed-diff workaround

## Problem

ariadne#424 (M2) writes the TL session file's `discussions:` index through couch's whole-file `read --all` / `write --all`, which reset the diff baseline for the whole file. To avoid consuming the operator's unread edits, `tl-lead`'s `syncIndex` decides no-ops by `Peek` and prints the pending diff (`readAllShowingUnread`) before every whole-file read: correct, but noisy. pair#643 (landed, pair 43313c59) added `couch --session-sync read --frontmatter` and `write --frontmatter … --if-hash H`, which move the baseline only for the frontmatter.
