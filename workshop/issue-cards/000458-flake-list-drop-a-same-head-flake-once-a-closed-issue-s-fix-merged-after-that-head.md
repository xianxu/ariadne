# flake list: drop a same-head flake once a closed issue's fix merged after that head

## Problem

`sdlc flake list` keeps showing a same-head fail→pass flake under "not registered (file or register today)" after an issue has fixed it. The 2026-10-19 pilot in pair hit this: five of the eight listed tests had been fixed and closed already (pair#585, #589, #609, #659), and each failing head predates its fix merge. The daily view asks for a filing that would duplicate a closed issue, and the real work gets lost among them. The same happened in ariadne with TestConstructScripts on a2b56335, which predates the #448 fix (6d623285).
