# construct a testable shim for every external service (gh/github first): the deterministic-shell mock pattern

## Problem

AGENTS.md §5 mandates process-level fakes ("external-service features ship a process-level
fake — function-call mocks miss interaction bugs"), but in practice we don't have them, and
it bites:

- `nous#41 #11` (re-invite hard-error fix) shipped with **zero automated coverage** —
  `gh` shells out to the CLI with no injectable seam, so it's only "dogfood-verified."
- `nous#26` (GitHub-mediated onboarding) shipped "build+vet pass" per milestone, then a
  manual run against real GitHub caught **five** control-plane bugs in succession (404 on
  the *validation* lookup not the add; `MinimalRepository` omitting `ssh_url`; stuck
  collaborator-but-unpublished state; discovery filter excluding provisioned-for-sharing
  brains; missing operator-pubkey publish). Every one was on the GitHub **control plane**,
  which our `file://` bare-repo integration tests model the **data plane** of but not.

Function-call mocks ("every `gh.AddCollaborator` returns nil") cover the trivial cases and
miss exactly these interaction bugs — the ones that only emerge from real-shaped responses
and multi-call state.

This is already an operator vision, not a new idea:
`brain/docs/vision/2026-05-19-01-pensive-auto-mocking-external-services.md` (and the earlier
`2026-05-04-01-pensive-auto-mock.md`), built on the deterministic-shell pensive
(`brain/docs/vision/2026-05-12-01-pensive-book-4-deterministic-shell.md`). This issue
promotes that vision to buildable work.
