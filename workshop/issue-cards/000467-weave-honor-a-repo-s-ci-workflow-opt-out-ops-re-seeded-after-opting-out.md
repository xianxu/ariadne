# weave: honor a repo's CI-workflow opt-out (ops re-seeded after opting out)

## Problem

ops' AGENTS.local.md says "ops opts out of ariadne's seeded CI workflows", yet a weave refresh in ops modified the tracked .github/workflows/merge-check.yml and added .github/workflows/local-gates-guard.yml. On 2026-10-19 the operator removed ops' CI workflow; the next weave refresh would seed it again.
