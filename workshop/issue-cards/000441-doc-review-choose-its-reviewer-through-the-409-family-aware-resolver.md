# doc-review: choose its reviewer through the #409 family-aware resolver

## Problem

`cmd/doc-review` hard-codes its reviewer (`DefaultAgent = AgentCodex`, "a different vendor from the usual co-authoring agent"). #409 gives sdlc one family-aware reviewer resolver (cross-family by default, visible fallback); doc-review does not use it, so a codex-authored document is reviewed by codex, and an unavailable codex has no visible fallback.
