# Make Weave dependency resolution worktree-aware

## Problem

During publication of parley.nvim#254, `weave compile` in a linked worktree
could not resolve `substrate ../ariadne` from `construct/deps`. The dependency
exists next to the primary checkout, but not next to the linked worktree:

```text
~/workspace/parley.nvim/../ariadne                         -> exists
~/workspace/worktree/parley.nvim/000254-.../../ariadne     -> absent
```

The first compile silently skipped the dependency, applied only four actions,
and pruned generated vocabulary. SDLC then refused the merge because the issue
schema was unavailable. Creating a sibling symlink to the real Ariadne checkout
allowed the next compile to apply99 actions and validation to pass. Worktrees
should not require this manual filesystem setup.
